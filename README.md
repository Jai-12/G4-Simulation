# G4-Simulation
This repository contains the code of a simulation with Geant4 (AnaEx01 folder) which was the topic of my bachelors thesis (Bachelors_thesis folder). The simulation riproduces the functioning of a scintillation detector revealing cosmic muons. In case of problems, my thesis can also be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3fsv7xfb698c069/AAD4GamO7W1HUvSro1DnDPDja?dl=0
